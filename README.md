## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I have a good understanding of the functionality and use of my application and how it could help parents like myself expand their childs palete. I want to make the best use of my time and tackle what I have set to be completely daily. 

### Weaknesses:

When it comes to CSS, I am like a dear in headlights, but I will use resources and ask for help when needed to my application appealing to the eye. Another area of weakness is time management and not being stuck on one aspect of the project. If I come across any hurdles or confusion, I can work on something else and get back to it another time

### Opportunities:

This project will help solidfy my understanding of React and I am excited to create something that I am passionate about. I am motivated to make it look minimal as well as be interactive.

### Threats:

Sometimes I can overthink things, when the issue may be a quick fix I find myself just over analyzing. Also, when I come across an error that I cant debug, I may be stuck on that issue for a while. But, I will seek help when needed. Also sticking to the project schedule cause I can easily fall off track if Im not intentional with time management.
