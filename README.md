# Project Overview

# Yumm
An app to discover organic meal recipes for infants and up.

## Project Description

Yumm is an Airtable and React build where the user is able to select different meal options for when a baby is ready to eat solids. The user also has an option to add a recipe that they found their baby to enjoy. From the homepage, the user is able to navigate to and click on one of three categories of choice that leads to a corresponding page populated with recipes catered to the childs age. Also, there is a form to add more and delicious meal ideas to the list. This app is website and mobile friendly.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I have a good understanding of the functionality and use of my application and how it could help parents, like myself, even caregivers, family and friends expand a childs pallete as they grow. I want to make the best use of my time and tackle what I have set to be completed daily. 

### Weaknesses:

When it comes to CSS, I am like a dear in headlights, but I will use resources and ask for help when needed for my application to be appealing to the eye. Another area of weakness is time management and not being stuck on one aspect of the project. If I come across any hurdles or confusion, I can work on something else and get back to it another time.

### Opportunities:

This project will help solidfy my understanding of React and I am excited to create something that I am passionate about. I enjoy cooking and knowing what is in the food that I prepare for myself and my child is an amazing feeling and important during her primitive years. I am motivated to make it look minimal as well as being fun and interactive.

### Threats:

Sometimes I can overthink things, when the issue may be a quick fix I find myself just over analyzing. Also, when I come across an error that I cant debug, I may be stuck on that issue for a while instead of asking for help. But, I will seek help when needed. Also sticking to the project schedule cause I can easily fall off track if Im not intentional with time management.
